# Algorithmic-Trading-with-SP500-A-Portfolio-Optimisation-Approach

## Overview

 This repository contains the implementation of a basic algorithmic trading system designed to predict stock market movements and identify optimal trading strategies. Leveraging machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, the project incorporates models for volatility prediction, sentiment analysis, and clustering-based market regime identification.
 
 Note: This is an incomplete version of the project and serves as a simple prototype. Future enhancements will include improved model integration, real-time data processing, and advanced trading analytics.

## Features

•	Volatility Prediction: Utilizes the GARCH model to forecast stock market volatility.

•	Sentiment Analysis: Processes Twitter data using VADER to compute daily sentiment scores, influencing trading strategies.

•	Market Regime Clustering: Employs clustering techniques (K-means) to classify different market regimes for better decision-making.

•	Trading Signal Generation: Combines insights from all components to generate buy/sell/hold recommendations.

## Usage

1.	Volatility Prediction:
	
    •	Open garch.ipynb to train and evaluate the GARCH model.
  
    •	Visualize predicted volatility trends over time.

2.	Sentiment Analysis:
   
	•	Use twitter_sentiment.ipynb to process Twitter data and compute aggregated sentiment scores.

	•	Requires API keys for accessing Twitter data (details in the notebook).

4.	Clustering for Market Regimes:
   
	•	Run unsupervised_trading_strat.ipynb to perform clustering on financial indicators.

	•	Generates market regime classifications for trading strategies.

6.	Trading Signal Generation:
   
	•	Combine outputs from all models to generate actionable trading signals (work in progress).

## Future Enhancements

•	Integrate real-time stock and sentiment data streams for dynamic decision-making.

•	Implement advanced sentiment analysis using transformer-based models like FinBERT.

•	Expand clustering analysis with more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models).

•	Develop a unified dashboard for real-time visualization of predictions and trading signals.
